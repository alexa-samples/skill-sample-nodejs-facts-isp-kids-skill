Adding premium content to your skill is a way for you to monetize your skill.  This sample skill has taken the basic fact skill and has added new categories as premium content for kids. This premium content is accessed through either a subscription or the one-time purchase of a given category that an authorized account owner (adult or parent) can make.  This sample code demonstrates how this feature can be used.

## Skill Architecture
Each skill consists of two basic parts, a front end and a back end.
1. The front end is the voice interface, or VUI. The voice interface is configured through the voice interaction model.
2. The back end is where the logic of your skill resides.
